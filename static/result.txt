india is first.okay,your question comes from reena.hi,miss india,i'm miss rita.people think climate change is a hoax.what would you do to convince them otherwise?honestly,my heart breaks to see how nature is going through a lot of problems,and it's all due to our irresponsible behavior,and i totally feel that this is the time to take actions and talk less,because our each action could either kill or save nature.prevent and protect is better than repent and repair,and this is what i'm trying to convince you guys today.thank you,thank you .
