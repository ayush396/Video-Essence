# Video-Essence
 Video Essence is a web application built to generate concise summary from textual data as well as video transcripts. 
This application makes use of Natural Language Processing to extract the keywords from the cleaned data to form sentences. These sentences are then tokenized and made into sentence vector and further into a similarity matrix. With the help of the similarity matrix a graph is made with nodes consisting of the sentences.Â  The sentences are lastly ranked on the basis of their similarity with other sentences and hence we obtain the summary.
